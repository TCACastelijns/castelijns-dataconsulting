# Description
The main business question was to get insights in the performance of 35.000 sensors in the electricity grid, generating TBs of time series data.

The challenge was to:

- Extract, Load and Transform (ETL) the sensory data into robust and scalable pipelines.
- Schedule the ETL jobs from a centralized server.
- Communicate the right descriptive statistics to the stakeholders to facilitate data driven decisions.

The end results are continuously monitored in a hosted dashboard that is refreshed automatically on a daily basis.
