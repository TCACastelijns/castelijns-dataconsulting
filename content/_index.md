### Value from Data
As Data Scientist and Engineer it is my passion to translate business data into **valueble** insights. With my experience as data science lead and consultant in a DevOps team, I am capable of creating, developing, testing and deploying highly adaptive services for your company. 

I am proficient in data preprocessing, predictive modeling and several data mining algorithms. I take a hands-on, **lead-by-example** approach while working on client projects.
